# 1 Introduction

In this lab, our objective was to implement unit testing for two Java classes within the provided JFreeChart project, relying on the given Java documentation. Utilizing the JUnit framework and Eclipse, we established a testing environment with mock objects and comprehensive test cases. The primary focus was on familiarizing ourselves with Eclipse's JUnit functionality, project setup, and integrating given JAR files. Our approach involved delving into the Java documentation to understand the methods in question and constructing partitions for Equivalence Class Testing (ECT) and Boundary Value Testing (BVT).

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

We initiated the testing process by reading the documentation to comprehend the functionality of both the DataUtilities and Range classes and their respective methods. Having developed a thorough understanding of these classes, we proceeded to plan and formulate test cases for 10 methods. Within the DataUtilities class, we selected all 5 of the methods as mentioned in the requirements. Similarly, for the Range class, we chose 5 out of its 15 methods. Subsequently, we identified the appropriate black-box test-case design techniques, such as equivalence classes and boundary conditions, to guide the implementation of our test cases.

The Unit testes were devised according to the principles of black-box testing, Equivalence Class Testing (ECT), and Boundary Value Testing (BVT). We partitioned our test inputs into 3 subsets, One had generalized legal inputs, another tested inputs near the boundaries which includes legal and illegal inputs, and the last tested the boundaries themselves with both legal and illegal inputs.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

At first, we encountered issues with the JFreeChart demo on MacBook laptops, leading us to switch to Windows machines for project creation in Eclipse. The lab document's complexity posed difficulties, especially in creating and using mocking objects for different classes. Overcoming work division challenges, we paired up for coding and reviewing tasks. Utilizing jMock for mocking objects facilitated test execution with pre-made objects, allowing us to simulate complex real object behavior. However, mocking has drawbacks, such as potentially overriding class logic, differing return types, and difficulty in use without available code. Despite its advantages, the intricacies of jMock and the need for extensive documentation made the process challenging.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

Overall, our experience with the lab provided a solid introduction to black-box testing, employing JUnit and JMock. While there were some discrepancies between the lab document and the actual JFreeChart System Under Test (SUT), particularly in the specified number of methods, the exercise effectively conveyed the benefits and limitations of black-box testing. The instructions for setting up the Eclipse environment for unit tests were valuable, highlighting the practical aspects of automated testing using JUnit. The hands-on nature of the lab allowed us to delve into testing a substantial system, providing insights into unit testing concepts and strategies, including the testing of external dependencies through the use of mocking.
